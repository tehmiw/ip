# Listie User Guide

![Ui](Ui.png)

Ever wanted a to-do list in the form of a chatbot?

Maybe even one that lets you track items in the form of deadline and events?

Listie is here to solve your oddly specific problem!

## Adding deadlines

If you wanted to add a deadline, you can do so by specifying the description and due date.

Example: `deadline return book /by 2019-10-15`



```
Got it. I've added this task:
 [D][] return book (by: OCTOBER 15 2019)    
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
```

## Update

You are also able to update items directly instead of deleting and adding them again.


## Local Storage

It wouldn't make sense if you had to add all your items again every time you closed the app.

Listie tracks your changes after you say 'bye', letting you can pick up where you left off.
